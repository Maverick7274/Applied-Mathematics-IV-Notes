\begin{itemize}
    \item We first need to find $h$ i.e. common difference between the intervals.

    \item To determine which rule is to be used, we need to find the number of intervals.

    \item If the numeber is divisible by $1$ then it is eligible for Trapezoidal Rule.

    \item If the number is divisible by $2$ then it is eligible for Simpson's $\sfrac{1}{3^{th}}$ Rule.

    \item If the number is divisible by $3$ then it is eligible for Simpson's $\sfrac{3}{8^{th}}$ Rule.

\end{itemize}

    \[h = \frac{(Upper\ Limit) - (Lower\ Limit)}{Total\ Number\ of\ Intervals}\]

        Example : Find $h$ for the following integral.
        \[ \int_{1}^{2} \frac{1}{x}, dx \]

            \[h = \frac{(Upper\ Limit) - (Lower\ Limit)}{Total\ Number\ of\ Intervals}\]
            \[h = \frac{2 - 1}{6}\]
            \[h = \frac{1}{6}\]
