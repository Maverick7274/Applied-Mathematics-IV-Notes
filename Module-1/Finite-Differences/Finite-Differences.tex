\section{Finite Differences}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Finite difference is a method of approximating the derivative of a function at a point by using the function values at nearby points.
  \item The finite difference method is used to solve ordinary differential equations that have conditions imposed on the boundary rather than at the initial point.
  \item The finite difference method is used to solve partial differential equations.
